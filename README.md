Jell-O wave effect for music app (iOS 10 Compatible)

## Uhh... How do I use this?
You don't. If you want to use the compiled tweak you should head over to my repo. (https://repo.c0ldra1n.gq/public)

## I'm a dev. How can I help?
Yay! Finally someone is willing to contribute!
TBH I don't really know what to say about helping. It's not the most beautiful code that you will ever see but I tried to make it more readable.

Do whatever you want to do with the source but just please don't release it without my permission.
